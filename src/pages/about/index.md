---
### Origins

> Started my adventure in software development with a Commodore 64 buyed by my daddy. I programmed a little bit then I forgert computer for a while because working with tapes and regulations seems to me a pain.
>
> Later my dad bought an amiga 64 and while my brother played with that computer, in some monthes found a helicopter game that was amazing and started to play with it and explored the Amiga Workbench as my first desktop environment (if I can call that environment a desktop).
>
> Later my dad bought a pc and as always it took me some times to find a way to use it, but once I starded playng with settlers 3 I almost never stopped to work and study pc until now.
>
> But the real origin of my passion about computers was the advice of my cousin to start studing computer science to get a work with.

### The first 15 years

> My first bunch of jobs was to do some free html editing for an association and for a local web agency based in Cesenatico.
>
> Then I spend some times learning some basics and playing around and to ocasionally work in other fields (postman, waiter, in the Olidata production line and as metalworker) trying to get a work in IT.
>
> The chance to work on IT arrived in 2014 and spent some times learning and working on Miscrosoft products.
>
> I thought the world ends where Microsoft ends, but in 2015 I found a way to escape that jail.

### The freedom

> Open source opened also my mind and gave me the ability to became aware of the internals of software development and of an hidden universe of opportunities.
