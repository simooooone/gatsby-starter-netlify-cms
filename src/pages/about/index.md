### Always drinked great quantities of coffee in my life

>

### Multiple origin

> Over Microsoft OSes and Frameworks I developed a career, but that was not enough for me. I want to dig deeper in the tools I use frequently. I want to see the code making happen the magic on my system, I want to be sure that software respects my privacy. It's me in fact whom opens the garden of my illusions and my idseas. I don't want someone abuse about that. I'm scared of the power of knowledge some tools/sites/applications/OSes. It's something very deep in my psycology and I know too much people scare the loose of control about his private data. So I trust in Open Source and Linux was the gate to introduce me in the free universe.

### Multiple directions

> I linke software development, but I landed to sysadmin hobby. My Raspberry PI 3 B+ - DietPi'd works like a charm. Got to find the path to make it works without any effort. I like domotic and I'm trying to setup my house to automatically do things. My motto is "setup and forget".

### Direct sourcing

> Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

> We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
