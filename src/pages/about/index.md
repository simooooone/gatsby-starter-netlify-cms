### Origins

> Started my adventure in software with Commodore 64 buyed by my dad. I programmed a bit (little bit) then I forgert computer fdor a while. Working with tapes and regulations seems to me a pain in the ass.
>
> Later my dad bought an amiga 64 and my brother plays frequently with that computer. I was disappointyred to work with such a rudimental computer but in some monthes found a helicopter game that was amazing and started to play around.
>
> Later my dad bought a pc and as always it took me some times to become acquaninted, but once I starded playng with settlers 3 (I never stopped to use pc's until now).
>
> But the real origin of my passion about computers was the advice of my cousin to start studing computer science to get a work with it.

### The first 15 years

### The freedom

> I like software development, but I landed to sysadmin hobby. My Raspberry PI 3 B+ - DietPi'd works like a charm. Got to find the path to make it works without any effort. I like domotic and I'm trying to setup my house to automatically do things. My motto is "setup and forget".
