  title: Why OkGrazie
  description: >
    OkGrazie was designed to compete with major classifieds websites, 
    carefully optimized for speed, and I was introducted to secure a website and a webserver.
description: >
  In 2011 I wanted to introduce me to a serious programming path, and I starded to searching for some business to not waste my time.
  I found that free classifieds were a good start and I thought (wrongly) that it was an easy business at that time to start with.

        I worked almost 2 years in my spare time on OkGrazie and I learnt too much things about the path that needs a programmer to call himnself a good programmer.
        I don't think to be a problem solver and in Math I am not too much acquainted.
        The biggest thing learnt was that I got great limits and working on a project was hard and complicated.

        First of all was the lack of material resources. Got a usb key with 1 Gb per month to navigate the web. I hadn't a smarphone, nor a good base of thecnological intoduction. I was by myself in all per all. I desn't follow nothing but facebook and ansa science to keep updated about thechnology news. All was based on Windows. I doesn't follow HN.

        I kept up and running this http://www.okgrazie.it for about 3 years from when I finished to code.
        Never had serious server issues.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
