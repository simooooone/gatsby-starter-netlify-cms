  title: Why OkGrazie
  description: >
    OkGrazie was designed to compete with major classifieds websites, 
    carefully optimized for speed, and I was introducted to secure a website and a webserver.
description: >
  In 2011 I wanted to introduce me to a serious programming path, and I starded to searching for some business to not waste my time.
  I found that free classifieds were a good start and I thought (wrongly) that it was an easy business at that time to start with.

        I worked almost 2 years in my spare time on OkGrazie and I learnt too much things about the path that needs a programmer to call himnself a good programmer.
        I don't think to be a problem solver and in Math I am not too much acquainted.
        The biggest thing learnt was that I got great limits and working on a project was hard and complicated.

        First of all was the lack of material resources. Got a usb key with 1 Gb per month to navigate the web. I hadn't a smarphone, nor a solid technological base. I was all by myself and the future was an ingocnita. I desn't follow nothing but facebook and ansa science to keep updated about thechnology news. All was based on Windows. I doesn't follow HN. All this because my English was poor and it was 2 years that I doesn't use a PC.

        From 2013 I kept up and running this http://www.okgrazie.it for about 3 years from when I finished to code.
        Never had serious server issues because I studied a lot and I resolved every little issue whaen I faced them. All on a single VPS, all by myself.
        Asking for SEO people and editors to help me but none was available for a project just born and without funds.
        But this was not an issue, I can understand that free working on a project managed by someone else was time intensive and without guatantees of a wealth future.

        I payed a good computer for a template layout, I asked my boss to join my business and finally in 2016 I put it offline to not pay VPS fee.
        Now I discovered open source and I want people look at my dream. I know, too much things are broken but I want to keep alive that work.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
