  title: Why OkGrazie
  description: >
    OkGrazie was designed to compete with major classifieds websites,  carefully
    optimized for speed, and I was introducted to secure a website and a
    webserver.
description: >
  In 2011 I wanted to introduce me to a serious programming path, and I starded
  to searching for some business to not waste my time. I found that free
  classifieds were a good start and I thought (wrongly) that it was an easy
  business at that time to start with.

        I worked almost 2 years in my spare time on OkGrazie and I learnt too
        much things about the path that needs a programmer to call himnself a
        good programmer. I don't think to be a problem solver and in Math I am
        not too much acquainted. The biggest thing learnt was that big dreams 
        are too big for humans.

        First of all I faced the lack of material resources. Got a usb key with 
        1 Gb of internet traffic per month to navigate the web. I hadn't a 
        smarphone, nor a solid technological base. I was all by myself and the 
        future was an ingocnito
        I desn't follow youtube or some courses to gain a good understanding. 
        All was based on Windows. I doesn't follow HN.
        All this because my English was poor and it was 2 years that I doesn't
        use a PC.
        I doesn't have a solid idea of software development nor open source.
        All source control was file/folder based.

        But I sarted from scratch and in 2013 I kept up and running this 
        http://www.okgrazie.it for about 3 years. Never had serious server 
        or security issues because I studied a lot and I resolved every little 
        issue whaen I faced them. All on a single VPS, all by myself. 
        Frequently in these years I searched for SEO and some editors to help 
        me but none was available for a project just born and
        without funds. Although I can understand that free
        working and free trust for a project managed by someone else was a 
        bad idea without guatantees of a wealthy future.

        I gave a good computer for a template layout, I asked my boss to join
        my business and finally in 2016 I put it offline for not pay VPS fee. Now
        I discovered open source and I want people look at my dream. I know, too
        much things are broken but I want to keep alive that work.
  heading: Worked like a charme with low resources requirement

    THere are some unresolved issues to work on but I thought always about speed 
    of my applications and websites and OkGrazie was carefully optimized for that target.

  heading: Great performances with no compromises

    For the algorythm part of the website I worked exclusively with arrays, and it was a 
    big gain in performace in comparsion to .NET 3.5 lambda functions.
    I tested it myself and found lambda very slow compared to arrays.
    In addition I compiled all my SQL querys in Stored Procedures inside SQL Server that 
    faced as a big gain.
    But I can't do without native components of ASP.NET and so I did not realized a complete
    custom application where I could control every aspect about the project.
    I found in fact that it was limitating too much the html I caould insert.
    Maybe one day it will be the next step. But I got not intention to keep up with okgrazie and think it is one of the many dead project.
