    Hanno vari soprannomi che io e e la mia compagna gli abbiamo dato nel tempo.
    Mushone e mushita, musho e musha, tommone e mimmina, maramao e mimmita,
    alcuni dovuti a dei loro comportamenti particolari, alcuni per evidenziare 
    il nostro senso delle cose, sempre in mutamento, come il nostro amore reciproco 
    e verso di loro che si evolve sempre verso qualcosa di meglio e più stabile.
    Ma anche per evidenziare il nostro non sapere dare un nome certo alle cose 
    ed un senso unico alla vita.

  Loro sono il risultato più grande del nostro amore, come due figli ai quali 
  donare ogni affetto

        I worked almost 2 years in my spare time on Okgrazie and I learnt too
        much things about the path that needs a programmer to call himnself a
        good programmer. I don't think to be a problem solver and in Math I am
        not too much acquainted. The biggest thing learnt was that big dreams   
        are too big for humans.

        First of all I faced the lack of material resources. Got a usb key with 
        1 Gb of internet traffic per month to navigate the web. I hadn't a 
        smarphone, nor a solid technological base. I was all by myself and the 
        future was an ingocnito
        I desn't follow youtube or some courses to gain a good understanding. 
        All was based on Windows. I doesn't follow HN.
        All this because my English was poor and it was 2 years that I doesn't
        use a PC.
        I doesn't have a solid idea of software development nor open source.
        All source control was file/folder based.

        But I sarted from scratch and in 2013 I kept up and running this 
        http://www.okgrazie.it for about 3 years. Never had serious server 
        or security issues because I studied a lot and I resolved every little 
        issue whaen I faced them. All on a single VPS, all by myself. 
        Frequently in these years I searched for SEO and some editors to help 
        me but none was available for a project just born and
        without funds. Although I can understand that free
        working and free trust for a project managed by someone else was a 
        bad idea without guatantees of a wealthy future.

        I gave a good computer for a template layout, I asked my boss to join
        my business and finally in 2016 I put it offline for not pay VPS fee. Now
        I discovered open source and I want people look at my dream. I know, too
        much things are broken but I want to keep alive that work.

    THere are some unresolved issues to work on but I thought always about speed 
    of my applications and websites and OkGrazie was carefully optimized for that target.

    For the algorythm part of the website I worked with arrays, and it was a 
    big gain in performace in comparsion to .NET 3.5 lambda functions.
    I tested it myself and found lambda very slow compared to arrays.
    In addition I compiled all my SQL querys in Stored Procedures inside SQL Server that 
    faced as a big gain.
    But I can't do without native components of ASP.NET and so I didn't realized a complete
    custom web application where I could control every aspect about the project.
    I found in fact that it was limitating too much the html I caould insert.
    Maybe one day it will be the next step. But I got not intention to keep up with okgrazie and think it is one of the many dead project.
